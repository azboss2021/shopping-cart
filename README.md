# Shopping Cart Project

## A mock store that lets you add any quantity of items to a shopping cart and remove them.

This project was built while following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The app is functional, but does not have a checkout function. Also does not have local or session storage. Try out the demo below.
